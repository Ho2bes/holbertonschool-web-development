# HTML Semantic Structure Project

This project is the first step in a series of exercises to build a complete webpage from scratch, starting with the HTML structure. The focus here is on creating semantic and valid HTML without any CSS or styling.

---

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- To implement a webpage from a designer's file using pure HTML.
- To understand and apply semantic HTML structure.
- To ensure that the HTML document is W3C-compliant.

## Designer File

The design for this project is available on **Figma**. To access it:

1. Create a Figma account if you don’t already have one.
2. Open the [design file](#) (link to the specific file or folder).
3. Use the “Duplicate to your Drafts” feature to access all design details.

## Important Notes on Figma

- If your computer displays missing fonts, you can download them from the following links:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - [Spin Cycle OT](#) (link to font source if available)
- Some values in the Figma file may appear as floats (e.g., `14.5px`). You can round these values if needed.

## Project Details

- **Scope**: For this project, only the HTML structure is required. CSS and JavaScript will be implemented in future tasks.
- **Standards**: Follow semantic HTML principles and ensure the structure adheres to web accessibility best practices.
- **Validation**: The HTML code must pass the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

## File Structure

- **Root Directory**: Contains the project’s main file:
  - `index.html`: The HTML structure for the webpage.
- **README.md**: This documentation file describing the project.
