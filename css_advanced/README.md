# CSS Advanced Project

This project is a continuation of the **HTML, advanced** project. The focus here is on styling the page using **CSS** to match the design provided in a Figma file.

---

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- To enhance the previously built HTML structure with appropriate styling.
- To replicate the design provided in Figma as accurately as possible.
- To learn and apply clean, efficient, and reusable CSS techniques.

---

## Figma Designer File

The page design is available on **Figma**. Follow these steps to access it:

1. **Log in or create a Figma account**.
2. Open the [Figma file](#) (insert the Figma link here).
3. Use **"Duplicate to your Drafts"** to have access to all design details.

## Important Notes on Figma

- If your system is missing the required fonts:
  - Download **Source Sans Pro** from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro).
  - Download **Spin Cycle OT** from your font provider.
- Values in Figma may include decimals (e.g., `14.5px`). **Round them** for simplicity.

---

## Requirements

- Copy the `index.html` file from the **HTML, advanced** project.
- Create and import a new CSS file (`styles.css`).
- Ensure the design matches the Figma file in every section:
  - Header
  - Banner
  - Quotes
  - Videos list
  - Membership
  - FAQ

- Keep your CSS clean and reusable:
  - Use centralized styles for common elements.
